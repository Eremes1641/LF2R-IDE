# Naming Convention
==========================================

To ensure consistency across the project, please follow these rules when naming:

- Format: Category + Verb + Noun
- Capitalization: Capitalize the first letter of each word (Pascal Case), except for technical term.
- Separator: Use spaces between words.
- For Boolean indicators or controls, add a `?` at the end of the name.

Example:
Correct				Incorrect			Comment
Menu Init			Init Menu			`Menu` is the category
Menu Act Save File	Menu Act save file	`Save File` should be Capitalized
Ev b Index			Ev B Index			`b` is a technical term


# Verb Definitions
==========================================
To maintain clarity and consistency, please use the following verbs with their intended meanings:

- `Set` / `Write`: Input arguments and store them into a variable/reference.
- `Get` / `Read`: Retrieve the value from a variable/reference.
- `Update`: Take the value from variable/reference A and store it into variable/reference B.
